# COVID-19 Curve
> A visual exploration of the scariest waves yet.

## Sources
All data used in this visualization is from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). It is solely focused on US States for now, but will ideally expand to all affected areas.

## Goal
This visualization is designed to more clearly explore the rate of change on a state by state basis. The two scales allow you to compare states evening, while also providing a higher-fidelity view of the curve no matter how far along the state is.

## Contributing
All PRs welcome, check open issues for some ideas.
